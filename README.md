Collect anonymous rated feedback from your team!

## About

Every team has different ideas and suggestions on how to work better and more efficiently, and every project lives from new feature suggestions. This tool is used to estimate which suggestions or features are the most urgent needs within a team or project community. It collects anonymous suggestions for improvement in a simple way and makes them available to the team or community for voting. If a suggestion reaches a certain number of votes, it can be presented to the management or the decision-makers, who can then directly assess how much support the team has for the suggestion.
